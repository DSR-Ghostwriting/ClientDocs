## My Google Docs workflow 

Over the years, I have worked with quite a number of clients of clients in Google Docs. As a Linux user, I prefer using Google Docs to Microsoft Office (less cross-platform compatability glitches).

However, at the same time, it brings with it some challenges. Like many writers, I find it hard to do my best work when other users are 'live' in the document. It just isn't comfortable and is the digital equivalent of sitting behind somebody at their workstation and watching them type.

In light of that, I have developed a methdology for working in Google Docs that I find makes for a more conducive editorial experience. I have described it in detail [here](https://medium.com/daniels-tech-world/a-way-to-comfortably-work-with-clients-in-google-docs-daa199efc50f?source=friends_link&sk=6ab99ed69b0835f9e3c938425f8863c9). But these are the essential points.

## 1. I Will Share A Folder With Your Team

Firstly, I populate my client folders in Google Docs from a template.

I created shared and 'not shared' folders like this

Please provide a list of all the users in your organization that will need access to the Google Docs.

Given that sharing permissions recurse through subdirectories, it's easiest to add them up front at this level. 

## 2. You Can Share The Folder With Your Client 

If you want to share the resources to anybody with the link — and understand the security implications — then I can also enable that sharing permission.

## 3. I Will Share the Finished Draft With You 


After each draft is finished — beginning with the first — I will copy it into the shared folder. If this is an ongoing project I will organize the shared folder with yy/mm subfolders.

Once the piece has been moved in I will notify you via the email collaborators functionality, or via my CRM, that it is ready for your review.

## 4. Collect Feedback and Let Me Know

Now the ball is in your court.

Please organize internally to collect the feedback from whatever stakeholders you deem necessary. 

When you have finished leaving comments and tracked changes please let me know.

I wlil then copy the documents — with suggestions and changes — back into my unshared folder. There, I will be able to action your changes while you will not be able to access the updated draft in progress.

The process repeats iteratively until the final draft is arrived at.
