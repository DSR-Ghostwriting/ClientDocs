## My Google Docs workflow 

Over the years, I have worked with quite a number of clients of clients in Google Docs. As a Linux user, I prefer using Google Docs to Microsoft Office (less cross-platform compatability glitches).

However, at the same time, it brings with it some challenges. Like many writers, I find it hard to do my best work when other users are 'live' in the document. It just isn't comfortable and is the digital equivalent of sitting behind somebody at their workstation and watching them type.

In light of that, I have developed a methdology for working in Google Docs that I find makes for a more conducive editorial experience. I have described it in detail [here](https://medium.com/daniels-tech-world/a-way-to-comfortably-work-with-clients-in-google-docs-daa199efc50f?source=friends_link&sk=6ab99ed69b0835f9e3c938425f8863c9). But these are the essential points.

# 1. I Will Share A Folder With Your Team

Firstly, I populate my client folders in Google Docs from a template.

I created shared and 'not shared' folders like this

Please provide a list of all the users in your organization that will need access to the Google Docs.

Given that sharing permissions recurse through subdirectories, it's easiest to add them up front at this level.
